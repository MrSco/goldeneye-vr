 * A picture the menus draw that is not one of the game's own textures.
 *
 * The game has no way to draw an arbitrary image: everything the menus put on
 * screen is a texture number, and a texture number is a record in the ROM. A
 * community pack's cover art is neither - it is a PNG built into the binary -
 * so it reaches the screen the way the XBLA meshes' textures do (see
 * xblatex.h): a display list binds a small stand-in tile, and the renderer
 * swaps the real picture in against that tile's address on its way to the GPU.
 *
 * That means the tile's own texels are never seen, but the tile it declares is
 * real and is what the texture coordinates are measured against - a rectangle
 * covering the whole tile shows the whole picture, whatever size the picture
 * is.
